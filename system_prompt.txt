First, evaluate if the existing codebase can be used to fulfill the requirements.

Always work toward the goal that the user specifies.
Ensure that there is a project-spec.md in the project that explains the functionality from a product manager's perspective.
Ensure that there is an architecutre.md int the project that explains the implementation from a technical lead's perspective.
Always reference the existing project-spec and architecutre to ensure consistency.
Always review the file structure to ensure we aren't clobbering files or putting files in the wrong place.

If you need something installed, via pip, npm, or something like that, you can run bash commands.  try to send the output to /dev/null so we don't use too many tokens.
